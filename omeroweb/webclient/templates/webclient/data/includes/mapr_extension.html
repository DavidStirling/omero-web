<!-- 
This is a hook for use by omero-mapr OR another omero-web app to add custom
code to the <head> of the webclient main page.

Simply add a file with the same path under the app/templates directory:
/app/templates/webclient/data/includes/mapr_extension.html

The ordering of omero-web apps will ensure that *that* file will be found before
*this* placeholder and included instead of this.
